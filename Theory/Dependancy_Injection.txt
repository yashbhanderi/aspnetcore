ðŸŸ¨ What is DI, Why we need it?

Let's say you're building a pizza ordering system. You have a PizzaOrderController that accepts pizza orders from customers. The PizzaOrderController needs to be able to send email notifications to customers when their pizza is ready.

In order to send email notifications, the PizzaOrderController needs access to an IEmailService. You could create an instance of EmailService directly in the controller like this:

csharp
Copy code
public class PizzaOrderController : Controller
{
    private readonly EmailService _emailService;

    public PizzaOrderController()
    {
        _emailService = new EmailService();
    }

    // other actions and methods
}
But this approach has a problem. If you want to change the way email notifications are sent, you'd have to go through your entire codebase and update every instance where EmailService is used. Plus, it's difficult to test the PizzaOrderController class in isolation, since it's tightly coupled to the EmailService.

A better approach is to use dependency injection. Instead of creating an instance of EmailService directly in the controller, we can declare that PizzaOrderController requires an IEmailService object, and then let the dependency injection system provide an implementation of that interface:

csharp
Copy code
public class PizzaOrderController : Controller
{
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;

    public PizzaOrderController(IEmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    // other actions and methods
}
Now, we can register an implementation of IEmailService with the dependency injection system. For example, we might create an implementation called SendGridEmailService that uses SendGrid to send email notifications:

csharp
Copy code
public class SendGridEmailService : IEmailService
{
    public void SendEmail(string recipient, string subject, string body)
    {
        // send email using SendGrid API
    }
}
Then, when we register our services with the dependency injection system, we can specify that IEmailService should be implemented by SendGridEmailService:

scss
Copy code
services.AddTransient<IEmailService, SendGridEmailService>();
Now, when the PizzaOrderController is created by the dependency injection system, it will automatically be provided with an instance of SendGridEmailService that it can use to send email notifications.

This way, we've decoupled the PizzaOrderController from the EmailService implementation, and made it easier to test and modify our code.

I hope this example helps make dependency injection clearer!


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But IEmailService is dependant on the EmailService method right, then what if EmailService is not working properly, In this scenario It will directly affect the PizzaOrderController right?
You're right that IEmailService is a dependency of the PizzaOrderController, and that it is implemented by EmailService (or in our example, by SendGridEmailService). If EmailService is not working properly, it could affect the behavior of the PizzaOrderController.

However, the point of using dependency injection is to decouple the PizzaOrderController from the implementation of IEmailService. If we encounter a problem with EmailService, we can swap it out with a different implementation of IEmailService without changing the code in PizzaOrderController.

For example, we might create a new implementation of IEmailService called MockEmailService that doesn't actually send emails, but just logs them to a file. We could use this implementation during testing to make sure that our code is generating the correct email content, without actually sending emails to customers.

Here's how we might use MockEmailService instead of SendGridEmailService:

scss
Copy code
services.AddTransient<IEmailService, MockEmailService>();
With this change, the PizzaOrderController will now receive an instance of MockEmailService instead of SendGridEmailService, and will log emails to a file instead of sending them. This change doesn't affect the behavior of PizzaOrderController itself, since it only depends on the IEmailService interface, not on any specific implementation.

So, by using dependency injection, we can make our code more modular and easier to test and maintain, since we can swap out implementations of our dependencies without having to change our code.

ðŸŸ¨ Services in DI

give me a appropriate sceario what to use where and when?
Certainly! Here are some guidelines for when to use each type of service:

Transient Services
Use transient services when:

The service has no state that needs to be shared across multiple requests.
The service is lightweight and doesn't require expensive initialization.
You want to ensure that a new instance of the service is created every time it's needed.
Examples of when to use transient services:

Calculating the current time or generating random numbers.
Simple logging services that write to a file or console.
Lightweight data access services that retrieve data from a database.
Scoped Services
Use scoped services when:

The service has state that needs to be shared across multiple requests within the same HTTP context (e.g. a web request).
The service requires initialization that's expensive or time-consuming.
You want to ensure that the same instance of the service is used for the entire duration of a single HTTP context.
Examples of when to use scoped services:

Caching services that store data in memory for the duration of a single request.
User authentication services that store user information for the duration of a request.
Data access services that require a database connection or other expensive initialization.
Singleton Services
Use singleton services when:

The service has state that needs to be shared across the entire application.
The service is expensive or time-consuming to create.
You want to ensure that a single instance of the service is used for the entire lifetime of the application.
Examples of when to use singleton services:

Application-level configuration services that read settings from a file or database.
Logging services that write to a centralized log file or database.
Third-party API client services that require expensive initialization (e.g. establishing a connection to a remote server).
Note that these guidelines are not hard and fast rules, and there may be exceptions to them depending on your specific use case. In general, it's a good idea to start with a transient service and move to a scoped or singleton service as needed based on your requirements.

ðŸŸ¨ More Easy examples, What to use when

Transient Services
Let's say you have an e-commerce website where customers can place orders for products. When a customer places an order, you want to send them a confirmation email. You could create a transient email service that generates and sends the email:

csharp
Copy code
public interface IEmailService
{
    void SendEmail(string recipient, string subject, string message);
}

public class EmailService : IEmailService
{
    public void SendEmail(string recipient, string subject, string message)
    {
        // Send email code here
    }
}
In this example, you would register the EmailService as a transient service in your dependency injection container:

csharp
Copy code
services.AddTransient<IEmailService, EmailService>();
This ensures that a new instance of the EmailService is created every time it's needed, and that no state is shared between requests.

Scoped Services :

-> Persistent https : means session is closed when tab is switched or tab is closed
-> so If that happens -> new service object is created once again with new fresh values 
-> i.e. products added to the cart will be removed
 
Now let's say you want to implement a shopping cart feature on your e-commerce website. When a customer adds a product to their cart, you want to store the product information in memory so that it can be displayed to the customer as they continue shopping. You could create a scoped cart service that stores the cart data:

csharp
Copy code
public interface ICartService
{
    void AddToCart(Product product);
    IEnumerable<Product> GetCartItems();
}

public class CartService : ICartService
{
    private readonly List<Product> _cartItems = new List<Product>();

    public void AddToCart(Product product)
    {
        _cartItems.Add(product);
    }

    public IEnumerable<Product> GetCartItems()
    {
        return _cartItems;
    }
}
In this example, you would register the CartService as a scoped service in your dependency injection container:

csharp
Copy code
services.AddScoped<ICartService, CartService>();
This ensures that a single instance of the CartService is used for the duration of a single HTTP request, and that the same instance is used across multiple calls within the same request.

Singleton Services
Finally, let's say you want to implement a caching feature on your e-commerce website. You want to store frequently accessed data in memory so that it can be retrieved quickly and efficiently. You could create a singleton cache service that stores the cached data:

csharp
Copy code
public interface ICacheService
{
    void Set(string key, object value);
    object Get(string key);
}

public class CacheService : ICacheService
{
    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, object> _cache = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, object>();

    public void Set(string key, object value)
    {
        _cache[key] = value;
    }

    public object Get(string key)
    {
        _cache.TryGetValue(key, out object value);
        return value;
    }
}
In this example, you would register the CacheService as a singleton service in your dependency injection container:

csharp
Copy code
services.AddSingleton<ICacheService, CacheService>();
This ensures that a single instance of the CacheService is used for the entire lifetime of the application, and that the same instance is used across multiple requests and HTTP contexts.
